Switched to Github pages -- saves a chunk of money + kinda fun to play with.

This site is based off [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) and then customized to try a couple ideas:
- ultra-short, title-only posts look **okay**
- *ephemeral posts* -- unless a post is *pinned* or given the *remain* attribute (like this post has), it'll eventually be discarded off the bottom of the page

<i class="fas fa-arrow-right-long fa-fw" /> all about making it easy to quick dash off (low effort?) updates.

Plus I get to write stuff in Emacs which is always nice.
